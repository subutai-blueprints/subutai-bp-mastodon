# Subutai Mastodon Blueprint

When installing the Mastodon Blueprint, Subutai will ask for an account name and an account email and an account 
password.

Notice, if this Blueprint is installed on a peer which can not send email (outgoing port 25 blocked), 
you will not be able to use the password recovery mechanism.
